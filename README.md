# DRAM Simulation Project

This project provides a comprehensive simulation framework for analyzing DRAM memory systems using DRAMsim3. The focus is on evaluating performance characteristics of different memory architectures, particularly HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), DDR3, and DDR4.

Key features include:
- Detailed simulation of memory timing, power consumption, and thermal behavior
- Support for various DRAM standards (DDR3, DDR4, HBM, HMC, GDDR)
- Performance comparison across different workloads (random, stream, matrix operations, etc.)
- Automated benchmark generation and visualization tools
- Thermal modeling capabilities for analyzing heat distribution

The project includes pre-configured memory controller settings and provides tools for generating custom memory access patterns. It's particularly useful for:
- Computer architecture research
- Memory system design optimization
- Performance prediction of real-world applications
- Educational purposes in computer engineering
